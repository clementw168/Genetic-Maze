# Genetic labyrinth

This project resolves a maze game where we can't see the maze but we know the distance to the exit. We use a genetic algorithm to solve it.

I did that project just to remind me what a genetic algorithm is and have a clean implementation reusable if I want. As I did it last year, but only decided to push it now, I won't take time to make a proper description. You can still see the French description of the project [there](https://github.com/clementw168/Genetic-Maze/blob/main/fiche_laby.pdf).
