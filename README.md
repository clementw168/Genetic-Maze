# Genetic labyrinth

This project resolves a maze game without seeing the maze but knowing the distance to the exit. A genetic algorithm is used to solve it.

I did that project just to remind me what a genetic algorithm is and have a clean implementation. The implementation is reusable for any project that needs a genetic algorithm. As I did it last year, but only decided to push it now, I won't take time to make a proper description. You can still read the French description of the project [there](https://github.com/clementw168/Genetic-Maze/blob/main/fiche_laby.pdf).
